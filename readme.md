#  Static Pages in react

*  Learn to “think in React”

#  What is a Library?
* Collection of reusable  code.
* Reduces need to write repetitive /complex things from scratch
* You can  Control how/when it’s used . No / few boundaries.

# What is a Framework?
* A framework is like a structure that provides a base for the application development process. With the help of a framework, you can avoid writing everything from scratch. Frameworks provide a set of tools and elements that help in the speedy development process.
* Angular Js , Vue Js ,  Next Js.  

# Why not to use a framework?
* Small Projects
* Network load Concerns
* Incompatibility.
* Learning Curve.

#  Why React?
* It is Composable
    * Earlier the complete web page used to be in one HTML code  that becomes messy.
    *  Use of Components in react
    *
* It is Declarative
* Declarative = Just tell me what needs to be done !
* Imperative = How should it be done? “”Describe every step on how it should be done“
* What is react DOM?
* What is JSX?
* Difference between JSX and DOM Elements?
* JSX is kind of a function that when it runs , returns us the object that react can interpret and use to create actual elements.
* ReactDOM.render method’s job  is to take react elements and interpret them in a way that turns them into real Dom elements that browser can understand.
* With JSX we need to make sure that we are only returning a single parent element .
*


* Q.  Why do we need to import react from react ?
        * Because the JSX syntax is defined in react.


*  Q . If I were to console.log(page) in index.js, what would show up?
A JavaScript object. React elements that describe what React should
eventually add to the real DOM for us


* Q .. What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?
            * Declarative means I can tell the computer WHAT to do
            * and expect it to handle the details. Imperative means I need
            * to tell it HOW to do each step.
* Q. What does it mean for something to be "composable"?
        * We have small pieces that we can put together to make something
        * larger/greater than the individual pieces.
