# Some questions.

- What is react DOM?

        ReactDOM.render method’s job  is to take react elements and interpret them in a way that turns them into real Dom elements that browser can understand.

- What is JSX?

        * JSX is kind of a function that when it runs , returns us the object that react can interpret and use to create actual elements.
        * With JSX we need to make sure that we are only returning a single parent element .

- Why do we need to import react from react ?

         Because the JSX syntax is defined in react.

- If I were to console.log(page) in index.js, what would show up?

         * A JavaScript object.
         * React elements that describe what React should
          eventually add to the real DOM for us
